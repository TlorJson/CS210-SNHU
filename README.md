SNHU CS210

*Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project is to create a monthly and annual interest calculator.

*What did you do particularly well?
  I'm not sure I can answer that question. I am my own worst critic and am incredibly hard on myself.

*Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could start with removing the outdated header in the InterestCalcMain.cpp file. I also could edit the code to be more verbose and validate input from the user.

*Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

*What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

*How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
