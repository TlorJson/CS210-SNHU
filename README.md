SNHU CS210

*Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project is to create a monthly and annual interest calculator.

*What did you do particularly well?
  I'm not sure I can answer that question. I am my own worst critic and am incredibly hard on myself.

*Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could start with removing the outdated header in the InterestCalcMain.cpp file. I also could edit the code to be more verbose and validate input from the user.

*Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The logic and math behind calculating the interest took me some time to understand, formulate, and translate into code. I will be adding more stack overflow resources
  and research in my future as well as math tools and research to understand formulas.

*What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Working with files is the biggest skill that I see that can be transferable to other projects. Most software is written in several different files and incorporated and compiled together.

*How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I attempted to break my code down into separate parts as well as including comments. The code does not validate user input or rather incorrect user input and can be expanded and worked on to include this.
